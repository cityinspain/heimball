# heimball

my own personal baseball API.

## in this repo

### /backend

a graphql API using prisma, apollo, and nexus. 

### /data_sources | /data_utils

python scripts that retrieve baseball data from various sources, such as the chadwick register and the MLBAM API

### /implementations

examples of how the API can be used to do cool stuff.

## to do

- reorganize data sourcing tools
- implement chadwick register grabber according to new structure
- document process of sourcing the data
- make a unified interface for sourcing the data, rather than relying on instructions
